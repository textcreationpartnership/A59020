            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

With the material Circumstances that attended it.</head>
            <p>MAny and Strange are the Delusions and Evil Suggestions of the Prince of Darkness, that Implacable Enemy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to undermine and overthrow the Felicity of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as in sundry Cases and Matters has been Evident, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dorcas Pinkney,</hi> a single Woman, of about 40 years of Age, by Profession a Child's Coat-maker, and working to divers Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Shops in and about <hi>London,</hi> was, some time past, observed by divers Persons to be much dejected with Melancholly, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the Family where she had lodged for many years; who narrowly observing her, and finding by her Discourse, Looks, and Gesture, that she was much disturbed in Mind, used no small Endeavour to reconcile her to her self, and in seeking to learn the Cause from whence the Defect proceeded; But her Answers to such demands and questions as were made, were dark and dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; insomuch that a fear of what has since too sadly happened,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37829:2"/>possessing them, they took what care they with modesty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience could, to prevent the worst, though their Diligence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Ineffectual: For she (on the 8th. Instant) going to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Evening (as was supposed) to Read, or Meditate, thereby to compose her mind; and the People of the House con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing (by the stillness they soon after observed that she took her repose) did not in the least doubt, or suspect the sad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence at that time; but the next morning, not finding her Chamber door open as usual, some of them hearkened, but heard no Voice, nor any manner of noise; which creating a Jealousie that something extraordinary had happened, calling up others, they knocked, desiring to know how she did, requiring her to open the Door, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but receiving no Answer, the suspicion of the unhappy Accident increasing, after often saying, they would break open the Door, to induce her to open it, if alive; they, with the help of some Neighbours, did open it; and entring the Room, found her sitting on the Bed, leaning against the Curtain, on the lower part of which she likewise sate as asleep: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon some were of the opinion, as being deceived by that Posture, not to wake her; but upon nearer view, perceiving a String of Tape or Filletting about her Neck, and observing her Face black, they upon feeling, found her Cold and Stiff; and further, that the String had been fastened to a Hook of the Bed-post, or Teaster; but with strugling, or the like, as is supposed, had been broken, though not as it appears, timely enough to save her Life: Yet whether or no she had made more than one Attempt or Essay of that kind, is uncertain: Yet certain it is, that the String appeared to have been broken and tied again, but how she came by it (all Mischievous Things of that, or any other kind, being as carefully as possible laid out of her way) is as yet altogether unknown. The dead Body thus found, the Coroner was the next day acquainted with the unhappy Accident: And Summoning a Jury, they after a strict Enquiry into the Circumstances that attended the Death and manner of finding the Party, as far as could be given by the People of the House, and others, found it <hi>Felo de se,</hi> or <hi>Self-Murther;</hi> but that she was Distracted. And though she had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten suggested a fear of Wanting e'r she died, which was thought to discompose her Mind; yet, upon Search, they found Money and other Things in her Chamber, which shew'd she was not in so great Necessity as she imagin'd. <hi>Finis.</hi>
